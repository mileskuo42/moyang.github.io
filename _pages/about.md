I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xinyu Xing](http://xinyuxing.org/). My research interests lie at the intersection of **AI Security** and **LLM Agents**, with a focus on:

- **Multi-turn Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
- **LLM Agents for Software Engineering**
- **AI Security and Watermarking**

Research Interests
======
My work explores how to make large language models more reliable, secure, and effective in real-world applications, particularly in automated software engineering tasks. I am passionate about developing novel approaches to align AI systems with human values while ensuring their robustness against adversarial attacks.

Education
======
- **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, Northwestern University, 2025 - Present
  - Advisor: Prof. Xinyu Xing

Selected Publications
